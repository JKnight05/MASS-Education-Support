# MASS Education Resources 
Welcome to the MASS Education Repo, here you will find the content for code and tutorials for requested sessions.
This is a live repo and subject to changes and improvements. What you see is by no means finished. 

## General Admin
Each topic has its own folder, within the folder is:
- A README, explaining the content, these will be developed over time.
- An .ipynb file (jupyter notebook) this goes through basic concepts and example code
- A folder (if applicable to the topic) of working project directory, run app.py. 

## What you can do 
If theres a topic you want covered let me know :-)
I cant garauntee a timeline for a turn around but will help where I can.
