Initially delivered on the 19/10/2025, this session shows students:
- The basics of SQLite
- Do's and Dont's
- Good coding practices

## user_authentication
The purpose of this teaching was to prepare students to use sqlite within their projects, specifically for user authentication. Within this folder is "app.py", this runs the customtkinter UI that interacts with the an SQLite db. Database.py has the functions (held in a class) for handling database interactions. "ui.py" has the functions, again held in a class, for supporting the customtkinter UI.
