# Database ERDs 

This week is somewhat simple and focused. Taught on 17/11/2025, the `basics.ipynb` shows you through how to create an ERD to the right normal form and style. Give it a read and try the tasks at the end !

You will also find two images that are good examples and keys to refer back to when creating your own.

No example implementation today as its probably best you get hands on and figure it out for yourself.

Have fun :)
